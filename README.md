# Music Composer

This project makes use of LSTM to compose music. The network is trained over midi files which consist of sequences of notes and chords. Upon minimizing the training error we observe that the network starts producing melodious sounds. Although currently the only supported audio format is midi, with the help of music transcription the support can be extended to variety of other formats.
